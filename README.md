# JSON Schema View

> This is a fork of [moshen1's json-schema-view](/moshen1/json-schema-view). It allows the user to expand $refs inside the UI.

**An AngularJS directive for rendering JSON Schema in HTML.**

JSON Schema is very verbose and hard to read in JSON. This directive helps rendering a JSON Schema in a user readable format.

The same module is also available in pure JavaScript with no dependencies. **Check it out [here](https://github.com/mohsen1/json-schema-view-js)**
